1. Incident commander name:
	High CPU Utilization - Detect crypto miners using the Stratum protocol

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
	3 crypto miners pods were being launched by running a script by the attacker

3. Summary of what was affected:
	The Attacker was able to infiltrate the kubernetes control plane and launched cryto mining related pods. As the results, the CPU usage was very high.


4. Summmary of the impact:
	As mentioned before, the pods are using a lot of CPU power. This can be seen through grafana CPU Utilization panel.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
    - Immediately evict the illegal pods run by attacker by using 'kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force'
    - Harden the security of the cluster by accessing scanning of kube-bench-hardened.
	- Using Falco-Prometheus and Grafana to easily monitor any suspicious or illegal activity running in the cluster


6. Summary of lessons learned:
    - Security vulnerability is easily exposed by any attacker. We should be actively running patches and do our best in hardening the security of the cluster/application. Especially in terms of administrative right, we should try to avoid using the privilege flag.
    - By having Grafana to monitor our application and cluster, it will save us a lot of trouble in recognizing any illegal activity that might occur.
